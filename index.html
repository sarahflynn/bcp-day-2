            <h2>How You Can Help Turtles</h2>
            <h3>Sea Turtles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turn Out Lights Visible From the Beach!</strong> Sea turtle hatchlings use light and reflections from the moon to find their way to the water atnight. Artificial lighting confuses the hatchlings and causes them to head inland instead ofout to sea â€“ putting them in dangerous situations which can lead to death. Artificial lights also discourage adult females from nesting on the beach. Short of turning off your lights, you can also take measures to shield, redirect and lower the intensity of the lights on your property.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce the Amount of Garbage You Produce and Clean Up Trash You See On the Beach.</strong> Sea turtles can become tangled in plastic and trash both on the shore and in the water. Discarded items such as fishing lines, balloons and plastic bags may also be confused for food and eaten by sea turtles, often resulting in injury or death.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Other Turtles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Help improve turtle habitat.</strong> Participate in local community or river cleanups. Healthy turtle populations start with a healthy habitat.</li>
                <li><strong>If you find turtles in a safe place, leave them there.</strong> Turtles are very slow to mature and very few hatchlings live to adulthood. For these reasons, removing any individuals from the wild can greatly impact local populations.</li>
            </ul>
